            Rachel has discovered the true location of her controllers, signaling that she’s nearing the game’s end. She
            anticipates a challenging final level, possibly disguised as an unpredictable event. As she contemplates her
            next move, unexpected flash warnings appear, claiming her site has been hacked. Uncertain if this is part of
            the game, she clicks on the warning, hoping it will lead her to the ultimate solution.
            **Help her find the last clue in order to get out of the internet and get her dream job all in her grasp.
            But remember if you are unable to do so she will meet the most gruesome fate of all time and will lose her
            dream job after getting so close to it.<br>
            Good luck!!
