            Now that it is confirmed that the Volkovs are behind this, it is now even more important for Rachel to
            complete her game as she knows she is right now being watched very closely. And if it is the Volkovs behind
            this then it is also clear that the only way out of the internet is for her to complete her game as soon as
            possible. Waiting for her next level to pop up in front of her she stumbles upon a cute robot lying on the
            floor made of thin silver wire like strings and picks it up out of sheer curiosity. It has a message on its
            torso, reading, “Can you help me find my lost friends??”. That was her cue to understand that she is
            supposed to find some robots or something related to it, but knowing the notorious minds of the Volkovs she
            knows it won’t be as easy and simple as finding some robots. She needs to be smart about her next move in
            order to solve this level. She walks further deep in the direction she found the robot where she finds a
            link floating in the air, will you help her out here as she can’t directly access the link given to her??
