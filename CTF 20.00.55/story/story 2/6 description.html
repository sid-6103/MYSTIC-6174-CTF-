            walks deeper and deeper in the vacant room she is right now transferred to after completing her previous
            level, thinking what is the next task and when will it pop up??

            blinks she thinks she is at a different place. The room’s interior doesn’t change but the place this room is
            in is definitely changing. That's when she notices a small file pop up in front of her.
