            Upon solving the previous task she starts hearing some weird kind of beeps. They are rhymed beeps but the
            rhythm is not constant nor are they anyways repeating in the same time interval or played with the same
            pattern. She starts searching her surroundings for the source of the sound but is constantly drawn to her
            system’s speakers which is weird as she recently cleaned her entire room including her system thoroughly. So
            it can’t be mice or any wire loose. She ponders over the reason behind the voice and decides to check her
            next level as she remembers about the fondness Volkovs have with code languages, especially morse code.
