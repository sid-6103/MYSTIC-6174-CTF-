            Rachel’s suspicions about the director’s assistant are confirmed. The Larsen Security project appears to be
            a Volkov trap, and she unwittingly walked right into it. Now, she must bypass official files and personally
            investigate the employees. As she delves deeper, an anonymous message arrives, hinting at Volkov
            involvement. Despite knowing the risks, Rachel clicks the link, plunging herself into a digital trap. Her
            gut churns, and she wonders who the real company snitch is—the key to her escape. 🕵️‍♀️🔍💻<br>
            And since she snatched into the internet from her system only she still has access to files on her system or
            connected to her system so she goes rampaging into the files she already has, but she might need your
            assistance to get through all the obstacles.
