            Rachel’s relentless pursuit nears unmasking the real informant. To confirm their identity, she revisits
            company files, focusing on her shortlist of suspects. This time, she sharpens her gaze, determined to expose
            the covert agent working for the Volkovs. As she sifts through the files, one stands out—an innocuous
            document adorned with seemingly random letters. Rachel’s instincts kick in; this isn’t mere timepass. The
            employee behind this coded message is cunning and notorious, a perfect fit for the Volkovs’ clandestine
            operations. Now, let’s unravel the enigma within those nuisance letters. Rachel deciphers each character,
            hoping it will lead her closer to the truth. The game intensifies, and she inches toward the heart of the
            conspiracy. But danger lurks, and Rachel Foster must tread carefully—every decoded letter could be her
            salvation or her downfall.
