            The protagonist’s earlier conclusion gains further support as she unravels the mystery. Now, her task is to
            solve the final level, but the Volkovs’ sudden ease and simplicity raise suspicions. Reflecting on the
            journey from the beginning, she realizes that all communication with the assistant occurred indirectly—via
            mail or other assistants. Examining the assistant’s photo, she recognizes a familiar face from the list of
            deceased individuals. Perhaps the initial warnings were not from the Volkovs but from her friends and the
            assistant, who sensed impending danger. If she fails to solve the last level, her fate mirrors that of her
            friends and the assistant. However, optimism drives her to click the link and face the challenge head-on. 🌟
            good luck !!!
