            The last clue she found in the previous file leads her to another location of files on her system. It has to
            have something crucial which will lead her to the end of the game she now thinks is teleported to as soon as
            she was snatched in the internet. As ever since she is being snatched in the internet she hasn’t find
            anything related to her project from the Larsen Security and neither have she found anything concrete about
            the real snitch that says have done anything unethical or anything that could harm the company, which only
            leaves her with one conclusion that Larsen Security is in reality, too, controlled by the Volkovs only, the
            same way the dark web is. In order to finish the game now she needs to find the last second clue of the game
            which she is sure is in the folder she is being directed to after unravelling the last clue in the previous
            files.
